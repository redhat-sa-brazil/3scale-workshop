# 3Scale Setup

## Description

This module will cover how deploy **3Scale 2.9** on **Red Hat OpenShift 4.6**

## Deployment

* As stated on [3Scale Operator Guide](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-operator/blob/master/doc/operator-user-guide.md#prerequisites) the following requirements must be met:

  ```
  3 RWO (ReadWriteOnce) persistent volumes
  1 RWX (ReadWriteMany) persistent volume
  3scale's System component needs a RWX(ReadWriteMany) PersistentVolume for its FileStorage when System's FileStorage is configured to be a PVC (default behavior). System's FileStorage characteristics:
    Contains configuration files read by the System component at run-time
    Stores Static files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc) uploaded to System by its CMS feature, for the purpose of creating a Developer Portal
    System can be scaled horizontally with multiple pods uploading and reading said static files, hence the need for a RWX PersistentVolume when APIManager is configured to use PVC as System's FileStorage
  ```

    * When using *RHPDS* you need to deploy an additional *Storage Backend (NFS, OCS, etc)* or create a *PersistentVolumeClaim* in order to sucessfully deploy **3Scale**.

      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
      metadata:
        name: system-storage
        labels:
          app: 3scale-api-management
          threescale_component: system
      spec:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: "100Mi"
        storageClassName: gp2
        volumeMode: Filesystem

      oc create -f kubernetes/pvc-storage.yml -n 3scale
      persistentvolumeclaim/system-storage created
      ```

    * if you want to customize **3Scale Password** then create a *Kubernetes Secret* with the following content:

      ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      metadata:
        name: system-seed
      stringData:
        MASTER_USER: admin
        MASTER_PASSWORD: redhat
        MASTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: redhat
        MASTER_DOMAIN: master
        ADMIN_USER: admin
        ADMIN_PASSWORD: redhat
        ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN: redhat
        TENANT_NAME: 3scale
      type: Opaque

      oc create -f kubernetes/seed.yml -n 3scale
      secret/system-seed created
      ```

* In order to deploy **3scale**, navigate to `Operators > Installed Operators > Red Hat Integration 3scale -> API Manager > Create APIManager` and deploy the *API Manager*

  ![API Manager Deploy](images/deploy-3scale/deploy-3scale-apimanager.png)

* If you prefer to use the command line, then create an *APIManager Object* as follows:

  ```
  apiVersion: apps.3scale.net/v1alpha1
  kind: APIManager
  metadata:
   name: instance-3scale
  spec:
   wildcardDomain: $domain

  oc create -f kubernetes/api-manager.yml -n 3scale
  ```

  * don´t forget to update the *wildcardDomain* section with your **OpenShift Application domain**. Example: `apps.openshift.mycompany.com`
  * when using *RHPDS* it´s recommended to disable *Kubernetes Resource Limits* and *Kubernetes Resource Requests* using [resourceRequirementsEnabled: false](https://github.com/3scale/3scale-operator/blob/master/doc/operator-user-guide.md#resources) property:

    ```
    apiVersion: apps.3scale.net/v1alpha1
    kind: APIManager
    metadata:
     name: instance-3scale
    spec:
     wildcardDomain: $domain
     resourceRequirementsEnabled: false

    oc create -f kubernetes/api-manager.yml -n 3scale
    ```

* Wait until all *pods* are successfully started. A similar output is expected:

  ```
  oc get pods -n 3scale
